# Firmware Onboarding
**Firmware** is a form of software used for the interfacing of hardware devices. For example, using a microcontroller to control a motor or handling input/output of a keyboard.

## Software for UGRT Firmware
### Linux (Ubuntu)
Some parts of the Rover, such as the NVIDIA Jetson, use Ubuntu as their OS. When working on something that will run on one of these parts, it is usually easier to develop and test on Ubuntu to prevent issues when loading your program on the actual machine.

You can install Ubuntu on a virtual machine, dual boot with Windows, or use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux). More information on Linux and how to install it can be found in [Info/Linux.md](Info/Linux.md) of this repository.

### Git and GitHub
Git is a version control system often used in the development and collaboration of source code.

GitHub uses Git to manage code repositories, but has extra features to help with task management and graphical management of the repository. 

Instructions and further resources for Git and GitHub are in [Info/Git.md](Info/Git.md).
